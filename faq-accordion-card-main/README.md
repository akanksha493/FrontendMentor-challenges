## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- javascript

### What I learned

This time I tried building the project with mobile first workflow and I can see why people prefer that, since it is much easier to scale things up once you have created a basic mobile version of something.
I also struggled a lot while positioning background images, like exactly how position work with them. So, that I learned as well.
