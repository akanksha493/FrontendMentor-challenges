## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I've focused a lot on responsive design, in addition to how this website will look in mobile(375px) and desktop(1440px) how it will appear in intermediate widths.
To do so, I used a lot of min, max, clamp functions of css. However when to use which are not much clear to me so I would like to learn more about it and user them in future projects.
