## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This helped me to further deepen my understanding of flexboxes, and how versitile they are for layout purposes. 
I also learn how to overlay a image, while building this project. 

### Continued development

In future also I would also like to do frontend project that would help me train my eye to for easiest way to build that layout.

### Useful resources

- [linuxhint/set-overlay](https://linuxhint.com/set-overlay-image-with-color/) - This helped me in setting image overlay.
- stackoverflow, googlefonts etc.
